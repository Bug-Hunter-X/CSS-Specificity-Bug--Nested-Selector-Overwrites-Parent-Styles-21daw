To resolve the specificity issue, several approaches can be taken, all focused on ensuring the desired styles are applied correctly.  Here are a couple of solution methods:

**Method 1: Using the `!important` flag (generally discouraged):**

While not best practice, using `!important` can force the parent's styles to take precedence. However, this is generally discouraged because it reduces code maintainability and can lead to harder-to-debug conflicts.

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue !important;
}

.container .inner {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

**Method 2 (Recommended): Increasing the specificity of the parent selector**

This method avoids `!important` and is a cleaner solution.  We add an extra class to the container element, which increases the specificity of the selector, ensuring it has higher precedence over the nested `.inner` selector.

```css
.container-parent {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container-parent .inner {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

This ensures that the parent styles apply correctly while allowing the child element to have its own unique styles. This method is generally preferred for better code maintainability and scalability.
